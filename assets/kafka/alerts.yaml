    annotations:
      description: Kafka cluster {{ $labels.kafka_cluster }} has {{ $value }} unclean
        partition leader elections reported in the last 5 minute interval. When unclean
        leader election is held among out-of-sync replicas, there is a possibility
        of data loss if any messages were not synced prior to the loss of the former
        leader. So if the number of unclean elections is greater than 0, investigate
        broker logs to determine why leaders were re-elected, and look for WARN or
        ERROR messages. Consider setting the broker configuration parameter unclean.leader.election.enable
        to false so that a replica outside of the set of in-sync replicas is never
        elected leader.
      summary: Kafka has unclean leader elections.
